Dumb app which should in the future help with blocking apps like youtube, twitter, instagram, etc. 
The app should have the following features for each app: 
1) Choose a time-slot for usage
2) Choose a max amount of minutes/ hours per timeslot
3) Choose option: After x minutes, the app blocks for x hours
4) Choosing depending off it being a day of the week

The whole motivation off the app is me learning Kotlin and me not trusting the other apps that do this.
The app will be open source and ill try to keep it the app as simple and minimalistic as possible so that the code is compact and easy to check for yourself (That way it will make verification of data-selling or similar very easy)
